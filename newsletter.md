**Newsletter - Gotham's New Time Tracking System**

Dear Gotham City Employees,

We are excited to share that the new time tracking system is now live, designed to streamline our work processes and improve transparency. This system will ensure that we meet the city's operational requirements while addressing some of the long-standing concerns brought up by our dedicated team members. Here’s an overview of the functionalities and how they work.

### **User Management**
You can now manage your profile with ease:
- Retrieve user information with email or username.
- Full CRUD support to ensure your details are always up to date.

### **Working Time**
Tracking your working hours has never been easier! Whether you're updating your timesheets or reviewing your past records, all is made simple:
- Record start and end times for your shifts.
- Make adjustments as necessary through updates and deletions.
- Review all working periods within the specified time range.

### **Clocking In and Out**
Clocking in and out is quick and hassle-free, helping you stay on track with your schedule.
- Keep accurate records of your clocking times with just one endpoint.

### **New Features**
We're also thrilled to introduce new features based on your feedback:
1. **Roles and User Roles**: You can now manage user roles efficiently. Assign, modify, or retrieve roles via our simple API.
  
2. **Training and Support**: We are committed to providing support and training.

Let’s embrace these new changes together and make Gotham City Hall a place of efficiency and fairness!

Sincerely,  
The Gotham City Hall Tech Team
